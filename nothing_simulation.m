% Parameters of Nothingness
existence = false;         % Does anything exist? No.
time = [];                 % Time has no meaning in nothingness.
space = zeros(0);          % Space is completely empty.
energy = 0;                % Total energy = 0
matter = nan;              % Undefined matter
meaning = '';              % No meaning
dimensions = 0;            % No dimensions
entropy = 0;               % No disorder because there's no order
consciousness = [];        % Who's even observing this?

% Equations of Nothingness
% Define the function of Nothing over Nothing in terms of Nothing
nothing = @(x) 0.*x;        % Everything gets reduced to zero
void = @(x) nan.*x;         % Undefined, empty, a whisper of chaos
