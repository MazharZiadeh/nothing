# Nothing Simulator

**A High-Fidelity MATLAB-Based Simulation Framework for the Emulation of Absolute Nothingness Under Null-Space Constraints**

Welcome to the void.

This repository contains a complete MATLAB-based simulation of **Nothing**. Yes, really. It doesn't calculate anything, it doesn't simulate any physical reality, and it doesn't output any meaningful result. It is the most accurate model of nonexistence currently available in the MATLAB ecosystem.

## ðŸ’¡ Concept

While modern simulation efforts attempt to model complex phenomenaâ€”from quantum entanglement to fluid dynamicsâ€”we went in the opposite direction. We asked:  
**"What happens if we simulate... nothing?"**

Thus, this project was born. A perfect digital manifestation of **zero** in both form and function.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Simulates **nothing** in real time.
- Zero iterations, zero variables (almost).
- Null entropy, undefined matter, absent time.
- Philosophically sound (aligns with Parmenides, Camus, and your existential dread).
- Includes a black screen to stare into for self-reflection.

## ðŸ§ª Getting Started

### Requirements

- MATLAB (any version after the Big Bang)
- Optional: A cup of black coffee and a looming sense of futility

### Run the Simulation

```matlab
run('nothing_simulation.m')
